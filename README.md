# PreciseSeek
Customize your backward and forward seek times on (hopefully) all video sites. For optimal experience, please use a device with a mappable (side) scroller or a (mechanical keyboard) knob.

## What is this?
It's a simple Chrome extension used to make the "-" and "=" keys into seeking keys (typically the functionality of arrow keys). The seek duration is customizable, allowing for a seek time as precise as you'd want.

## How do I use this?
- Download my files and place into a folder.
- In Chrome, go to Extensions -> Load Unpacked -> Import **the folder**
- Once installed, click on the Extension -> Option -> pick whatever seek time you'd like and hit **Save**

## QA
#### When I hit save, the values returned to 1 and 2.5 again, how do I make it save my value?
> It's saved, I just didn't bother with making confirmation feedback. Check the address bar if you want to see the current set values.

#### It's not working for X site, please fix it?
> I'm using a very big brain method to identify the video feed, so if X site isn't working when it works on YT and other popular sites, X site is ass.

#### Will there be any updates?
> This project is made for personal use. The creator just plopped it here for backup. So no, don't expect anything, just enjoy the free extension.
